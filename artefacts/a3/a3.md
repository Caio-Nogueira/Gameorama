# A3: User Interface Prototype

This user interfaces prototype (or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

1. Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artefact includes three elements:

1. Overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages;
2. Overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the users(sitemap);
3. Identification and description of the main interactions with the system, organized as sequences of screens (wireflows).

The interface's descriptions are presented on the end of the document.

## 1. Interface and common features

**Gameorama** is a web application based on HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

**Figure 1:** Interface's guidelines.

2. **Navbar**
3. **Page Content**
4. **Footer**

In this figure some characteristics common to all pages are highlighted:

- We opted for a "net design" to have a flowing web page layout that suits various screen sizes, from desktop 19" or more, to 11" tablets, or even to 4" smartphones.
- The common links and buttons to the various pages maintain their position to deliver a consistent user experience.
- Most buttons and clickable text are highlighted in blue (with a few exceptions) when hovered while the rest of the website maintains a consistent color palette of orange, black and white.


## 2. Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.

The sitemap gives the project team an idea of how the website is going to be build by helping to clarify the information hierarchy.

## 3. Wireflows

Wireflows are presented to represent some of the main interactions with the system using a sequence of interfaces and explaining how navigation is done between them.
