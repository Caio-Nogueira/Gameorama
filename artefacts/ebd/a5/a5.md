# A5: Relational Schema, validation and schema refinement

This artifact contains the Relational Schema obtained by mapping from the Conceptual Data Model. The Relational Schema includes the relation schema, attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys and other integrity rules: UNIQUE, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, CHECK.

## 1. Relational Schema

Relation schemas are specified in the compact notation:

| Relation reference | Relation Compact Notation                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R01 | member(<u>id</u>, username **UK** **NN**, fullName **NN**, email **UK** **NN**, password **NN**, bio, profileImage, bannerImage, aura **NN**) |
|  | memberFollow(<u>idMemberFollower</u> → member, <u>idMemberFollows</u> → member) |
| R02 | administrator(<u>id</u> → member)                           |
| R03 | newsPost(<u>id</u>, title **NN**, text, date **NN**, aura **NN**, <u>owner</u> → member) |
| R04 | topic(<u>id</u>, name **UK** **NN**)                         |
| R05 | topicFollow(<u>idTopic</u> → topic, <u>idMember</u> → member)                             |
| R06 | comment(<u>id</u>, text **NN**, date **NN**)                             |
| R07 | reply(<u>idComment</u> → comment, idParent → comment)        |
|                    | postImages(<u>id</u> → newsPost, file **NN**)                |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |
|                    |                                                              |

**Note:** UK means UNIQUE KEY, NN means NOT NULL, DF means DEFAULT and CK means CHECK.

## 2. Domains

The specification of additional domains can also be made in a compact form, using the notation:

| Domain Name | Domain Specification |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
|             |                      |
|             |                      |


## 3. Functional Dependencies and schema validation

To validate the Relational Schema obtained from the Conceptual Model, all functional dependencies are identified and the normalization of all relation schemas is accomplished.

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |
|      |      |
|      |      |
|      |      |
|      |      |
|      |      |
|      |      |

As all relations schemas are in the Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF), the relational schema is also in the BCNF and therefore there is no need to be refined using normalisation.
