Cheaters made up just 0.01% of the player base, and People Can Fly are hoping that the number won''t grow in the launch period for the full game.\nTo prevent this from happening, People Can Fly has implemented a number of repercussions for cheaters, which will be account-wide.\nYou will not be able to matchmake with legit players\nMatchmaking will likely take significantly longer\nYou will still be able to play solo\nIn future, your HUD will have a discreet but visible watermark placed on it so that gameplay footage created on this account can be readily identified as coming from a flagged account.\nAll accounts will be checked for historic cheating on April 1st, launch day, and then at "regular intervals" following that date. If you did cheat during the demo but you still want to start the game without the mark of the false shepherd, then you need to "delete all characters and items on your entire account" to start fresh. Naturally, if you cheated in the demo, don''t attempt to carry that progress over to the main game, or you will be branded.\n\nIf you''re wondering what People Can Fly considers cheating (at which point, perhaps you''ve already lost your way) here are a few habits to stay away from:\nIntentionally running the game on PC without Easy Anti Cheat (EAC)\nModifying game files to enhance a character: levels, skills, inventory, etc.\nExternally modifying game time to reduce time dependent features such as vendors and challenges\nUsing a trainer program or similar to gain advantages within the game\nUsing gameplay altering programs such as aimbots or wallhacks\nDon''t worry if you did use the above-board farming routes to pick up extra loot during the demo. People Can Fly has said that "farming is not considered cheating," but did lament the unethical "battering" that the loot-stuffed Captain miniboss suffered during the demo phase.\n\nOutriders is launching on April 1 worldwide for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S and Google Stadia.

This guide covers everything you need to know so you can get started with a wealth of information already in your metaphorical inventory.\nBeginner''s Guide to Monster Hunter Rise\nMonster Hunter Rise''s gameplay loop is the main objective - it looks pretty simple, but is incredibly deep and satisfying if you invest time to master your weapon and forge unique armor sets. Prepare, Hunter a Monster, Make Better Stuff, and repeat!\n\nHere are the steps, with everything you need to know about each of them. Click to jump to that part of this page.\n\n1. Prepare\n\nFirst, prepare for a quest! Check the Village and Multiplayer Hub Key Quests - Walkthrough for details on how to choose a quest and progress the story.\n\nChoose a Weapon\nManage Your Inventory\nEquip the Right Gear\nEat a Meal\n\n2. Hunt a Monster\nPick Up Endemic Life (And Items)\nTake Advantage of the Wirebug and Wyvern Riding\nHow to Tell a Monster''s Status\nKill or Capture?\n\n3. Make Better Equipment (and more!)\nCheck the map by holding minus and talk to everyone with a chat bubble to get new optional quests, free items, and more.\n\nBuddies: Palico and Palamutes\nThe Argosy and Meowcenaries - Free Item Farming!\n4. Repeat!\nThat''s it! Continue prepping your equipment for the best advantage against the monster you''re up against next.\n\nPrepare for a Hunt\nEverything you should do when preparing for a hunt, especially your first one. Heads up, there are also tutorials you can accept from the village hub.\n\nChoose a Weapon\nYou start Monster Hunter Rise with basic models of all 14 types of weapons - you can see this equipment, and change it out, by selecting any Item Box within the village. Each weapon is wildly different! See the Weapons page for details about each of them, controls and tutorials for each, and advice on which weapons are best for beginners.\n\nTry them out in the Training Area - you will be able to fast travel within Kamura Village by bringing up your map by holding the minus button and choosing it. However, you''ll need to head to the Training Area physically by taking the dinghy from the Buddy Plaza before you can fast travel.\n\nManage Your Inventory\nIn between hunts, you''ll need to manage your item pouch. Luckily, this is made incredibly simple by registering an item loadout at the Item Box. Then, emptying and restocking your pouch is as easy as choosing a Loadout at the item box.\n\nSee Recommended Item Loadouts for ideas on what to bring with you on hunts, from instant heal Max Potions to attack-boosting Demondrugs.\nEquip the Right Gear\nYou''ll unlock more weapons and armor to craft as you slay new monsters and acquire more items! Check back in between quests to see what''s new.\n\nAt first, you won''t have many options, but look at the monster you''re about to face and the equipment you have on. Probably don''t want to face a fire-breathing Rathalos with negative fire resistant, or use a water element weapon on a bubbly Mizutsune. And, don''t forget about your Palicoe''s and Palamute''s gear!\n\nYou’ll get armor spheres that simply upgrade Armor’s defense, but don’t bother on the basic Kamura garb. Hold onto them until you craft a piece of armor you know you''ll want to keep. P.S. Armor Skills will become more important later, but for now just make sure to choose armor pieces that aren’t completely irrelevant to you. Like, if you don’t use Hunting Horn, don’t pick a chest piece with Horn Maestro that only affects Hunting Horns.\n\nEat a Meal\nLastly, always eat before a quest! Dango always increases your max health and stamina, and grant individual skills - like elemental resistances. If you forget, you can eat (and change equipment and items) inside the tent on a quest.\n\nHunting a Monster\nEverything you need to know about actually hunting down a monster on a quest.\n\nPick Up Endemic Life (And Items)\n\nAlways go to the blue supply box! The items included will give you a hint of what to use to heal from a monster’s status inflictions, or what to use to exploit them - like Screamer Pods against Lagombi’s Sensitive ears - at least in Low Rank and Village Quests.\n\nYou can’t keep most supply box items given to you by the guild, so use them before your own.\n\nPick up *everything* as you travel around - mining points, plants, mushrooms, insects, etc. Trust me, you’ll probably need that stuff eventually.\n\nEndemic Life is super useful! If you’re having trouble, make a concerted effort to collect buffs before engaging with a monster. Some of them can be used as items, too!\n\nAt the end of a quest, don’t sell any reward items, just take them all. You can always sell excess stuff later for a quick buck.\n\nTake Advantage of the Wirebug and Wyvern Riding\n\nThe Wirebug and Wyvern Riding are new to everyone, and are fantastic tools to take down monsters even faster and more fluidly. See Wyvern Riding Guide - How to Mount and Tips and Wirebug Guide, Tips, Controls for exactly how to utilize these cool game mechanics.\n\nHow to Tell a Monster''s Health and Status\nMonsters don''t have health bars in Monster Hunter Rise - instead, you can tell how it''s feeling by its actions and behavior. If it''s drooling, it''s exhausted; if it limping, it''s close to defeat (and capturable - also indicated by the blue icon); if acting erratically, or otherwise has a change in appearance, it''s usually enraged and will be more difficult to fight, and will break out of traps faster.\n\nKill or Capture?\n\nCatching a monster always shaves off a few minutes of a hunt vs. slaying it, but some materials are easier to get one way or the other. Check the Monster page in this wiki for that info if you haven''t unlocked that information in your own Hunter''s Notes yet, and How to Capture Monsters to learn how.\n\nMake Better Equipment (and more!)\nAfter hunting a monster, check the Smithy for new equipment to make! Check the map by holding minus and talk to everyone with a chat bubble to get new optional quests, free items, and more - and occasionally do the following!\n\n\nAfter your first Village Hub Urgent Quest, The Argosy will arrive in the Buddy Plaza. Send your buddies out to collect the items you need or are running low on - like Honey (for Mega Potions!) so you don’t run out. It beats having to go out and gather them yourself, like I had to do back in my day…\n\nSend Buddies out with the Meowcenaries to gather field items and monster materials.\n\nCheck the Cohoot nest in this tree in the Buddy Plaza for free stuff, like Steel Eggs, which you can sell!\nYou don’t have to check on the Argosy and Meowcenaries after every quest, but look occasionally and switch out when needed (which you can do from your housekeep). Trading with the Argosy and Meowcenaries is also how you get unique materials to unlock some cool new equipment!\n\nMake sure to always train buddies you don’t take with you at the Buddy Dojo - and recruit new ones if needed from Imori. Palicoes have different types and different attacks, so try out a variety. Plus, the higher level your buddies, the more they can do when trading with The Argosy, or when sent on missions with the Meowcenaries.', TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01 15:07:12', 26);
